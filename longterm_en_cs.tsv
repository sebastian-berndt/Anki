Big-Oh Notation	If \(f,g\) are two functions from \(\mathbb{N}\) to \(\mathbb{N}\), then: \begin{enumerate} \item \(f =O(g)\) exists if there exists a constant \(c\) such that \(f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n)\) for every sufficiently large \(n\),\item \(g=O(f) \implies f=\Omega (g)\)\item \(f=\Theta(g) \iff{} (f = O(g) \land g= O(f))\)\item \(f = o(g)\) if for every \(\epsilon > 0, f(n) \leq \epsilon \cdot g(n)\) for every sufficiently large \(n\),\item \(g=o(f) \implies f=\omega(g)\) \(g=o(f)\) \end{enumerate} To Emphasize the input parameter, another notation is \(f(n)=O(g(n))\) instead of \(f=O(g)\). Similar notations can be used for \(o,\Omega,\omega,\Theta.\)

Oracle Turing Machine	An oracle Turing machine \(M\) is a \(TM\) that has a special read-write tape oracle tape and three special states \(q_{query},q_{yes},q_{no}\). In addition to the input there is a language \( O \subseteq \{0,1\}^{\ast}\) used as the oracle for \(M\). Whenever during the  execution \(M\) enters the state \(q_{query}\) the machine moves into the state \(q_{yes}\) if \(q \in O\) and \(q_{no}\) if \( q \not \in O\), where \(q\) denotes the contents of the special oracle tape. Regardless of the choice of \(O\), a membership query to \(O\) counts as a single computational step.

If the graph is undirected, then the endpoints of \(e_{i}\) are \(v_{i}\) and \(v_{i+1}\). If the graph is directed, then \(e_{i}\) is an arc from \(v_{i}\) to \(v_{i+1}\).
