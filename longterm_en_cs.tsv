Alphabet	In formal language theory, an alphabet \(\Sigma\) is a non-empty set of symbols.
Big-Oh Notation	If \(f,g\) are two functions from \(\mathbb{N}\) to \(\mathbb{N}\), then: \begin{enumerate} \item \(f =O(g)\) exists if there exists a constant \(c\) such that \(f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n)\) for every sufficiently large \(n\),\item \(g=O(f) \implies f=\Omega (g)\)\item \(f=\Theta(g) \iff{} (f = O(g) \land g= O(f))\)\item \(f = o(g)\) if for every \(\epsilon > 0, f(n) \leq \epsilon \cdot g(n)\) for every sufficiently large \(n\),\item \(g=o(f) \implies f=\omega(g)\) \(g=o(f)\) \end{enumerate} To Emphasize the input parameter, another notation is \(f(n)=O(g(n))\) instead of \(f=O(g)\). Similar notations can be used for \(o,\Omega,\omega,\Theta.\)
Clique Number	The clique number \(\omega(G)\) of a graph \(G\) is the number of vertices in a maximum clique in \(G\).
Clique Problem	In graph theory, the clique problem is the computational problem of finding cliques/complete subgraphs in a graph.
Clique/Complete Subgraph	A clique or complete subgraph \(C\), in an undirected graph \(G = (V, E)\) is a subset of the vertices, \(C \subseteq V\), such that every two distinct vertices are adjacent.
Complete Graph	In graph theory, a complete graph is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.
Condition \(P(x)\) holds for sufficiently large \(x\)	A condition \(P(x)\) holds for sufficiently large \(x \in \mathbb{R}\) if there exists some \(X \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \(P(x)\) holds for every \(x > X\). \[\exists x \in \mathbb{R}: \forall x \in \mathbb{R}: x \geq X \implies P(x)\]
Directed Simple Graph Density	For directed simple graph density is defined as: \[D=\dfrac{|E|}{|V|(|V|-1)}\]
Dominating Set	In graph theory, a dominating set for a graph \(G = (V, E)\) is a subset \(D\) of \(V\) such that every vertex not in \(D\) is adjacent to at least one member of \(D\).
Dominating Set Problem	The dominating set problem concerns testing whether \(\gamma(G) \leq K\) for a given graph \(G\) and input \(K\).
Domination Number	The domination number \(\gamma(G)\) is the number of vertices in a smallest dominating set for \(G\).
Formal Language	A formal language \(L\) over an alphabet \(\Sigma\) is a set of words over that alphabet.
Independent Set/Stable Set	In graph theory, an independent set or stable set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent.
Maximal Clique	A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by including one more adjacent vertex, that is, a clique which does not exist exclusively within the vertex set of a larger clique.
Maximum Clique	A maximum clique of a graph \(G\), is a clique, such that there is no clique with more vertices.
Maximum Independent Set	A maximum independent set is an independent set of largest possible size for a given graph \(G\).
Minimum Vertex Cover	A minimum vertex cover is a vertex cover of smallest possible size.
Multigraph	A multigraph is a graph which is permitted to have edges that have the same end nodes. Thus two vertices may be connected by more than one edge.
One-Tape Turing Machine	A one-tape turing machine is defined as a \(7\)-tuple \(M = \langle Q, \Gamma, b, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F \rangle\) where: \begin{description} \item[\(Q\)] is a finite, non-empty set of states \item[\(\Gamma\)] is a non-empty set of symbols \item[\(b \in \Gamma\)] is a blank symbol \item[\(\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma \setminus \{b\}\)] is the set of input symbols \item[\(\delta :(Q\setminus F) \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L,R\}\)] is a partial function called the transition function \item[\(q_0 \in Q\)] is the initial state\end{description}
Set Independence Equivalence	A set is independent if and only if its complement is a vertex cover.
Simple Graph	A simple graph, as opposed to a multigraph, is an undirected graph in which both multiple edges and loops are disallowed. In a simple graph the edges form a set (rather than a multiset) and each edge is an unordered pair of distinct vertices.
String/Word	In formal language theory, a string or word is defined as a finite sequence of symbols .
Symbol/Letter	In formal language theory, the elements of an alphabet are called symbols or letters.
Turing Machine computes a function	Let \(f: \{0,1\}^ \ast \rightarrow \{0,1\}^\ast\) and let \(T: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) be some functions, and let \(M\) be a Turing Machine. We say that \(M\) computes \(f\) if for every \(x \in \{0,1\}^\ast\), whenever \(M\) is initialized to the start configuration on input \(x\), then it halts with \(f(x)\) written on its output tape.
Undirected Simple Graph Density	For undirected simple graph density is defined as: \[D=\dfrac{2|E|}{|V|(|V|-1)}\]
Vertex Cover	A vertex cover \(V'\) of an undirected graph \(G = ( V , E )\) is a subset of \(V\) such that \(u v \in E \Rightarrow u \in V' \lor v \in V'\), that is to say it is a set of vertices \(V'\) where every edge has at least one endpoint in the vertex cover \(Vâ€™\). Such a set is said to cover the edges of \(G\).
Vertex Cover Number	The vertex cover number \(\tau\) is the size of a minimum vertex cover: \[\tau = |V'|\].
