Big-Oh Notation	If \(f,g\) are two functions from \(\mathbb{N}\) to \(\mathbb{N}\), then: \begin{enumerate} \item \(f =O(g)\) exists if there exists a constant \(c\) such that \(f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n)\) for every sufficiently large \(n\),\item \(g=O(f) \implies f=\Omega (g)\)\item \(f=\Theta(g) \iff{} (f = O(g) \land g= O(f))\)\item \(f = o(g)\) if for every \(\epsilon > 0, f(n) \leq \epsilon \cdot g(n)\) for every sufficiently large \(n\),\item \(g=o(f) \implies f=\omega(g)\) \(g=o(f)\) \end{enumerate} To Emphasize the input parameter, another notation is \(f(n)=O(g(n))\) instead of \(f=O(g)\). Similar notations can be used for \(o,\Omega,\omega,\Theta.\)

Closed Walk	A closed walk consists of a sequence of vertices starting and ending at the same vertex, with each two consecutive vertices in the sequence adjacent to each other in the graph. In a directed graph, each edge must be traversed by the walk so that the edge must be oriented from the earlier of two consecutive vertices to the later of the two vertices in the sequence.

Minimum Vertex Cover	A minimum vertex cover is a vertex cover of smallest possible size.
Minor	An undirected graph \(H\) is a minor of another undirected graph \(G\) if a graph isomorphic to \(H\) can be obtained from \(G\) by contracting some edges, deleting some edges, and deleting some isolated vertices.
Multigraph	A multigraph is a graph which is permitted to have edges that have the same end nodes. Thus two vertices may be connected by more than one edge.
One-Tape Turing Machine	A one-tape turing machine is defined as a \(7\)-tuple \(M = \langle Q, \Gamma, b, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F \rangle\) where: \begin{description} \item[\(Q\)] is a finite, non-empty set of states \item[\(\Gamma\)] is a non-empty set of symbols \item[\(b \in \Gamma\)] is a blank symbol \item[\(\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma \setminus \{b\}\)] is the set of input symbols \item[\(\delta :(Q\setminus F) \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L,R\}\)] is a partial function called the transition function \item[\(q_0 \in Q\)] is the initial state\end{description}

Regular Graph	In graph theory, a regular graph is a graph where every vertex has the same degree or valency.
Set Independence Equivalence	A set is independent if and only if its complement is a vertex cover.
Simple Graph	A simple graph, as opposed to a multigraph, is an undirected graph in which both parallel edges/multiple edges and loops are disallowed. In a simple graph the edges form a set rather than a multiset and each edge is an unordered pair of distinct vertices.

Symbol/Letter	In formal language theory, the elements of an alphabet are called symbols or letters.
Trail	A trail is a walk in which all edges are distinct.
Turing Machine computes a function	Let \(f: \{0,1\}^ \ast \rightarrow \{0,1\}^\ast\) and let \(T: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) be some functions, and let \(M\) be a Turing Machine. We say that \(M\) computes \(f\) if for every \(x \in \{0,1\}^\ast\), whenever \(M\) is initialized to the start configuration on input \(x\), then it halts with \(f(x)\) written on its output tape.
Vertex Cover	A vertex cover \(V'\) of an undirected graph \(G = ( V , E )\) is a subset of \(V\) such that \(u v \in E \Rightarrow u \in V' \lor v \in V'\), that is to say it is a set of vertices \(V'\) where every edge has at least one endpoint in the vertex cover \(Vâ€™\). Such a set is said to cover the edges of \(G\).
Vertex Cover Number	The vertex cover number \(\tau\) is the size of a minimum vertex cover: \[\tau = |V'|\].
Walk	A walk of length \(k\) in a graph is an alternating sequence of vertices and edges, \(v_{0},e_{0},v_{1},e_{1},v_{2},\ldots ,v_{k-1},e_{k-1},v_{k}\), which begins and ends with vertices. If the graph is undirected, then the endpoints of \(e_{i}\) are \(v_{i}\) and \(v_{i+1}\). If the graph is directed, then \(e_{i}\) is an arc from \(v_{i}\) to \(v_{i+1}\).
